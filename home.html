    <h1 class="header">West Bend Microwaves: Are They Really What the People Want?</h1>
    <figure>
      <img src="microwave.jpg" width="600" height ="500">
      <figcaption>The interface here is created to help users cook their food using a West Bend microwave, and is used differently depending on how users intend on cooking their food. All users must first insert their food into the microwave by grabbing hold of the handle, pulling it open, and inserting their food. Once that is complete, the user can either utilize one of the preset commands (such as pizza), which automatically sets the time and starts the microwave to a predetermined amount of time. Otherwise, the user can click “time cook” on the top left corner, and manually set the time that they desire.</figcaption>

    <h2> To bring this question to light, we observed THREE people using the microwave, then interviewed them about their experiences. Here are some key observations:</h2>
    <h3> <span class="user1">User 1</span>:</h3>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="user1">User 1</span>, a roommate that uses the microwave often, jogged to the microwave</li>
        <li>While looking down on his phone, <span class="user1">User 1</span> opened the microwave, inserted burrito into microwave, closed the microwave, and hit the “pizza” button, thus indicating a strong sense of familiarity with the mechanism</li>
        <li>About a minute later, <span class="user1">User 1</span> looked at the microwave clock and asked me if he had selected “Dinner Plate”, to which I responded “No, you hit Pizza”. <span class="user1">User 1</span> immediately indicated (to me) that he meant to click dinner plate, but then decided to just leave the microwave running</li>
        <li>About 4 minutes in, <span class="user1">User 1</span> just opened the microwave door while it was running running, took burrito and plate from microwave, and left in a hurry, forgetting to close the microwave door</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3> <span class="user2">User 2</span>:</h3>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="user2">User 2</span>, another roommate, approached the microwave with a bowl of frozen stir-fry and immediately began examining all the buttons, taking ~20 seconds to choose “frozen vegetables” option </li>
        <li>However, once the microwave started running, user looked at the microwave clock, exclaimed “Shoot” and canceled the microwave run using the stop/cancel button on the bottom left corner — indicating that not only were they unfamiliar with that specific preset option, but also that the frozen vegetable option was not the correct option for this situation</li>
        <li>User then hit time cook in the top left corner and set the timer to 1 minute 45 seconds. User then intently looked at the food cooking, changing head angles from time to time to get a different look at the food</li>
        <li><span class="user2">User 2</span> opened the handle with about 10 seconds left, took food, and shut door</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3> <span class="user3">User 3</span>:</h3>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="user3">User 3</span>, who is not a roommate, was invited to use the microwave to warm up a cup of coffee that she had made earlier after a long night of studying for a Biology exam</li>
        <li><span class="user3">User 3</span> inserted the cup of coffee into the microwave and hit “3”, and was puzzled when the microwave started to run as he hit the first number — displaying unfamiliarity with this particular microwave interface</li>
        <li><span class="user3">User 3</span> immediately hit stop/cancel and called on <span class="user2">User 2</span> for help, asking him how to make the microwave run for only 30 seconds</li>
        <li><span class="user2">User 2</span> showed <span class="user3">User 3</span> the “Time Cook” button, to which <span class="user3">User 3</span> responded “this microwave makes no sense” with a tone of displeasure. <span class="user3">User 3</span> then inputted desired time (30 seconds)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2> Here Are What the Users had to Say About Their Experiences:</h2>

    <h3>Why are you using this microwave as opposed to other alternatives?</h3>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="user1">User 1</span> is using a microwave because he is warming up a burrito from yesterday. Using other forms of heating would neither be efficient nor really useful in this situation.</li>
        <li><span class="user2">User 2</span> is also using a microwave for the sake of time and efficiency. Although he usually cooks stir-fry on the stove, the pack of frozen stir-fry she got this time around recommended using a microwave.</li>
        <li>Finally, <span class="user3">User 3</span> is also using a microwave for the sake of efficiency. Using other forms to reheat a cup of coffee just seemed “excessive” (as she put it).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>What are the key features of your “perfect” microwave?</h3>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>All users said the same things: a set of numbers to input time, accessible handle to open/close microwave, 3-4 preset options, and a timer.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>How did you think this microwave operated before you first used it?</h3>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li> For this answer, all users answered similarly as well. They stated that they expected either click a preset button, or type in a specific number and hit start to begin the microwave.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Did you run into any issues when operating this microwave? If so, what were they?</h3>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="user1">User 1</span> mentioned that the buttons on the microwave are too close together, which make it easy to accidentally click the wrong thing.</li>
        <li><span class="user2">User 2</span> mentioned the fact that it is hard for him to use the preset options because of the fact that he “doesn’t know what each one means”. Furthermore, he mentioned that the fact that he had to hit “Time Cook” before typing in the number was quite irritating, and that he did not enjoy the built in “express cook” option.</li>
        <li><span class="user3">User 3</span> reiterated the issue with “Time Cook”, stating that he wished that the microwave would not start microwaving the minute he pressed a number without pressing “Time Cook” first.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Was there anything that confused you or anything you found unnecessary?</h3>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="user1">User 1</span> doesn’t like the number of preset options. He thinks it’s excessive.</li>
        <li><span class="user2">User 2</span> stated the “Time Cook” issue.</li>
        <li><span class="user3">User 3</span> also stated the “Time Cook issue.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>How does this microwave compare to other microwaves you’ve used?</h3>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="user1">User 1</span> just stated the the microwave is generally fine. He didn’t have any additional comments</li>
        <li><span class="user2">User 2</span> liked it in regards to the number of options, stating that it was “interesting”, but took issue with the “Time Cook” button.</li>
        <li><span class="user3">User 3</span> said it was worse than other microwaves, also citing the “Time Cook” issue.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Can you make any recommendations on how to improve this microwave?</h3>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="user1">User 1</span> recommended reducing the number of preset option to 3 - 4</li>
        <li><span class="user2">User 2</span> recommended removing the “Time Cook” option.</li>
        <li><span class="user3">User 3</span> also recommended removing the “Time Cook” option.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 style="color: #cc9900"> These observations and responses led to the development of TWO personas represented by empathy maps: <span class="HastyHarry">Hasty Harry</span> and <span class="PensivePenny">Pensive Penny</span></h2>
    <figure>
      <h2><span class="HastyHarry">Hasty Harry</span></h2>
      <img src="hasty_harry.png" width="600" height ="600">
      <figcaption>Figure 1: <span class="HastyHarry">Hasty Harry</span> is a full-time student who is taking more classes than he can manage. He is usually in class for 6 hours a day, has leadership positions in 4 different clubs, and is usually behind on homework.</figcaption>
    </figure>
      <div class="discriptions">
      <p><span class="HastyHarry">Hasty Harry</span> represents a subset of microwave users that use the microwave for its convenience and the fact that it does not require the same amount of commitment as a typical stove or oven. The primary interface issues that this persona faces is that the buttons on the microwave are placed to close together — making it easy for someone like him who is constantly on the move to accidentally press the wrong button and incorrectly cook their meal.</p>
    </div>

    <br>

    <figure>
      <h2><span class="PensivePenny">Pensive Penny</span></h2>
      <img src="pensive_penny.png" width="600" height ="600">
      <figcaption>Figure 2: <span class="PensivePenny">Pensive Penny</span> is a perfectionist who loves cooking meals for her friends. For this particular meal she’s making, she is forced to use the microwave — something that she typically does not use (unless she’s making oatmeal or some other microwave-based meal).</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <div class="discriptions">
      <p><span class="PensivePenny">Pensive Penny</span> represents a subset of microwave users who rarely cook food using a microwave unless absolutely necessary, as individuals like <span class="PensivePenny">Pensive Penny</span> really enjoy the control and perfectionism that cooking on a stovetop on in an oven allows them to attain. The primary interface issues that Penny faces is the number of preset options that exist on the microwave, along with the fact that the microwave immediately starts once one of buttons is pushed. In order to really know what option to choose, it’s important for this persona to know what each option comes with — including cook time, heat intensity, and if there are any pauses — before this persona makes a decision on what preset option to choose from.</p>
